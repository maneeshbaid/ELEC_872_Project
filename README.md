This git repository contains the code for implementing three new methods: CNN-LSTM with Multi-Head Attention, CNN-TCN, CNN-TCN with Multi-Head Attention for MHEALTH and the WISDM dataset. We utilized the code by Singh et al. [1], available on GitHub [2], as a baseline for our code. Chatgpt [3] was also used to complete the code.
</br>
Datasets are available in the dataset/LOTO folder, and the code for these new methods is under the codes/model_proposed folder.
## Setup
1) Make sure python 3 is installed.
2) Run this command - pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary packages.
